WARNING:tensorflow:From /usr/local/lib/python3.6/dist-packages/tensorflow/python/ops/init_ops.py:1251: calling VarianceScaling.__init__ (from tensorflow.python.ops.init_ops) with dtype is deprecated and will be removed in a future version.
Instructions for updating:
Call initializer instance with the dtype argument instead of passing it to the constructor

Instructions for updating:
Use tf.where in 2.0, which has the same broadcast rule as np.where
